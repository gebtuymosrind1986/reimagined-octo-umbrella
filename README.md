To change blank and missing categories in Quicken, open the "Vendor Invoices" section and filter the invoices for those specific categories. Next, review those with empty fields or missing designations. Use the bulk adjustment feature to select multiple invoices simultaneously.

Select the invoices that need adjustment by checking the boxes next to them. After selecting, find the "Edit" option in the toolbar and choose "Change Category." This allows you to customize the category for all selected invoices at once.

Specify the new category for these invoices. Make sure to double-check the date range for accuracy. This helps ensure you are updating the correct bills, especially if they are due soon.

Once you've made your selection, confirm the change. Quicken will apply the new category across all selected invoices, providing a streamlined approach to managing your vendor invoicing. Regularly reviewing categories can prevent issues with tracking expenses.

Steps to Change Default Due Date for Invoices in Quicken

To customize the default due date for invoices in Quicken, follow these simple steps. First, open Quicken and navigate to the **Preferences** menu. Look for the **Invoicing** section. Here, youâ€™ll find options to adjust the default settings for your invoices.
